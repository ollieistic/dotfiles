## My Dotfiles
This repository holds all my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for Hyprland. They are made for Arch but should work on any other Linux distro.

A couple configurations are not made by me and are taken from other public repositories.  
I'm sorry for not giving credit, I've forgotten the original authors (yes, I know I should've pushed to GitHub earlier).
